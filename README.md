# All-Python-projects

I started learning python in september 2022, this is the first programming language which I learned.
This repository consists my starting projects, work, challenges and assignments.
I completed my first course on CodeHS which enhance my problem solving skills and basic knowledge as well as concepts of coding and programming.
With the sake of learning python I understand basic data types and syntax of programming languages and further I continue learning python with other courses and challenges.
I started coding and solving Hackerrank challenges so how I continue learning more and more functions and concepts about python.
I created some very primitive games as to improve and examine my coding skills.
This repository inclueds Codehs important assignments, Hackerrank and Mosh challenges and some games etc.
